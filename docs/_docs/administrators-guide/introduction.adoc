= Introduction
Welcome to the Ignite Administrators Guide.

This guide is designed for people tasked with Ignite cluster administration.

Once you've installed Ignite, you will want or need to perform many different administrative tasks â€” everything from migration and security, to deploying, monitoring, and upgrading your clusters. Some of the topics listed in the table of contents are useful right away, and others you may not need until later (or not at all, depending on your use case).
